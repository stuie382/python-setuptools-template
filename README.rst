# Python project starter

This project is a Python project template that includes unit tests, mocking, test coverage, and test reporting tools to allow a project to have CI through Jenkins.

You will need to:

* Fork this repo
* Create a new development branch in the repo
* Use Git to rename the `projectsrc` and `projecttest` directories to something relevant
* Update the packages and description sections of `setup.py` to have your source package name (that you just changed) and a suitable short description of your project
* Update this README to be relevant to your project
* Commit and push all these changes to your development branch
* Add your repository to Jenkins, and test that Jenkins can checkout and build
* Start creating feature branches off of your development branch
